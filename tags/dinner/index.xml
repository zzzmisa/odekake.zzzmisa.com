      <description>I had known that aging meat is a trend, but this night I went to eat the aging fish. I thought&amp;hellip;it might be stale!? According to a shop flyer, temperature control is very difficult, so aging management is done by chefs. I do not want to try this at home. I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand what the difference between fresh fish and aging fish, was but both were delicious!</description>

      <description>I had a dinner at Owl Café, which is called Owl Café Crew, in Mino City. I wondered if owls are nocturnal and are more active at night, so I visited at dinner. I rubbed them! It was fluffy! I was satisfied with not only the owls but also the foods The galette was unusual meal for me and it tasted so good.</description>
